# AliceChes
## About project
Chess is a very popular game. She has many different types, and one of them is Alice's chess. The main change is that the game is played on two boards between which the chess pieces move after each move. 

This is an interesting attempt to do it on my own and a very necessary experience for me.
## To do 
- [] Create generated boards
